\fakesection{IDP Project}

\fakesubsection{Light Up}

\texttt{blocked(p1,p2)} holds iff p1 and p2 lie in the same column/row but a wall is separating them.

\fakesubsection{Train Tickets}

\texttt{requiredType:TicketType} represents the required type of the tickets that the passenger can obtain. It's used for convenience (and efficiency, maybe).\\
\texttt{halts($s_1$,$s_2$)} holds iff the passenger stops at $s_1$ after stopping at $s_2$.

\fakesubsection{Nurikabe}

\texttt{onIsland(i,p)} holds iff p is indirectly connected to some numbered cell (i.e. it belongs to the island represented by that cell).
