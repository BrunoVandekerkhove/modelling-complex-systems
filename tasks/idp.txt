*** Light Up ***

 - blocked(p1,p2) holds iff p1 and p2 lie in the same column/row but a wall is separating them.

*** Train Tickets ***

 - requiredType:TicketType represents the required type of the tickets that the passenger can obtain. It's used for convenience (and efficiency, maybe).
 - halts(s1,s2) holds iff the passenger stops at s1 after stopping at s2.

*** Nurikabe ***

 - onIsland(i,p) holds iff p is indirectly connected to some numbered cell (i.e. it belongs to the island represented by that cell).

*** Time Spent on Project ***

I spent 14 hours on the project.
