REPORT FOR THE PROJECT ON IDP

--------------------------------------------------

*** Light Up ***

 - blocked(p1,p2) holds iff p1 and p2 lie in the same column/row but a wall is separating them.

*** Train Tickets ***

 - requiredType:TicketType represents the required type of the tickets that the passenger can obtain. It's used for convenience (and efficiency, maybe).
 - halts(s1,s2) holds iff the passenger stops at s1 after stopping at s2.

*** Nurikabe ***

 - connected(p1,p2) holds iff p1 and p2 are cells with both land of both water in them and they're connected, directly or indirectly. Indirect connectivity is modelled with a transitive closure.

*** Time Spent on Project ***

I spent 14 hours on the project. 11 hours writing the code and a few more hours removing misinterpretations / errors.

--------------------------------------------------
CONSIDERED ALTERNATIVES
This can (and probably should) be ignored.
They're alternative theories that were considered.
--------------------------------------------------

*** Nurikabe (alternative for efficiency) ***

 - onIsland(i,p) holds iff position p is (indirectly) connected to some numbered cell at position i (i.e. it belongs to the island represented by that cell).
 - sea(p) holds iff position p is (indirectly) connected to the top-most water-cell in the left-most column that happens to have a cell with water in it. This cell is unique so it allows for an inductive specification of a unique body of water which is called the sea.
